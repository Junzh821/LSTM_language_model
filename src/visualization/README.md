The script *visualize_embeddings.py* allows you to visualize word embeddings on tensorboard. Depending on the embeddings you want to visualize you will have to adapt the paths in the script.

After running the *visualize_embeddings.py* script you can inspect the embeddings on tensorboard by running:

tensorboard --logdir='~/lstmLanguageModel/models/tensorboard/embedding_visualization/'
